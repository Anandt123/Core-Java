Constructors :

->  Constructor is a special type of method which is written within the class and the 
    class name and method name’s are same.
    
->  Constructor will get executed whenever the object is created.

->  Every class must and should have constructor, if we didn’t write any constructor then 
    compiler will create default constructor at compile time.
    
->  There are two types of constructor’s are there,
       1.   Zero argument.
       2.   Parameterized constructor.
       
->  Whenever the class contain any constructor then we can not write default constructor.

      *  Constructor can not be Declared as Static.
      *  Constructor can not be Declared as Non-static.
      *  Constructor can not be Declared as Final.
      
->  If we specify written type (void) for the constructor it will consider it as a normal
    method.
