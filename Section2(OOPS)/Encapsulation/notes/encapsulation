          Encapsulation :
          
->  The main use of Encapsulation is to achive security for the datamembers 
      against the invalid values of the class.

->  Data member and Function members which are modifying the value of data member 
    shall be declared in same class.
->  we need to declare the data members as Private and give the access to getters
    and setters are also known as "JAVA-BEAN" or "PLAIN OLD JAVA OBJECT --> POJO"
    
       *  Declaring data members as private and grant the access
          through getter and setter methods is called encapsulation
    
    GETTERS : it returns the current value of data members.
              it returns the value the return type of datamember is Declared.
              
    SETTERS : *   setter method updates the value of the datamember.
              *   it behaves like a constructor so its return type is void.
              *   return type of setter method will be usually void because it 
                   doesn't return any value.
