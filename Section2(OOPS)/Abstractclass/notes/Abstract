Abstract method(): A class contains only declaration of the method no defination of the method 
                    that type of method is called as Abstract method().
                    
Abstract class : Any class contains atleast one Abstract method() then that type of class is
                 called as Abstract class.
                 
                 Abstract --> INCOMPLETE
                 Concret --> COMPLETE
                 
->  Abstract method() in java are declared with Abstract Keyword. if the class contain atleast
    one Abstract method() then that class is also declared with Abstract.

->  It is impossible to create OBJECT of Abstract class.
->  We can create refrence variable of Abstract class.

->  Any class inheriting the properties of Abstract class then the Subclass must override all
    the Abstract methods present in the Superclass OR we have to declare the Subclass as Abstract 
    class,inorder to inherit.
    
->  By creating the OBJECT of Subclass whenever we want call the Abstract method then it perform 
    the implementation of the Subclass to the Called Method.
    
    
  *   Abstract can not be Declared as Static
  *   Abstract can not be Declared as Final
  *   Abstract can not be Declared as Private
  
  
->  Inside the Abstract class we can write Only Abstract methods() OR
                              we can write Only Concrete methods() OR
                              we can write Both Abstract methods() &
                              Concrete methods().
                              
->  In an Abstract class we can declare a method as Static or Non-static.
->  In an Abstract class we can declare the Datamembers as Static or Non-static.

-> STATIC members of the Abstract class can be Accessed by using Classname with Membername.
-> NON-STATIC/NON-PRIVATE members of the Abstract class can be Accessed ONLY/STRICTLY by 
    creating the Object of Subclass.
