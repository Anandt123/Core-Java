->  String value is the group of characters which is written in the Double Quotes.
->  We can access the characters or perform any operations on the string only by
    using the methods of string.
->  internally string value is stored as a character array by the JVM.

->  In java String is a class which is used to store group of chars the String Object.
->  String class is immediate sub-class of object class.
->  String class impliments Serializable, Comparable<String>, Charsequence interface.

->  String class is final and it can't be inherited.

->  String Objects are created in Special memory area called String pool in heap area.
  
    * string pool consist of two parts.
        1)constant pool.
        2)non-constant pool.
    
->  String objects can be created in 2 different ways
        1)By using new operator
        2)without using new operator
        
        
->  if you create a String object without using new operator then the Object will be 
    created in Constant pool.
->  if you create a String object with using new operator then the Object will be 
    created in Non-Constant pool.
    
->  Within constant pool Duplicates are not allowed.
->  Within Non-constant pool Duplicates are allowed.

NOTE :  { == }       Operator compares address of given two objects.
        { .equals }  Operator compares value of given two objects.
       
       
        
->  Hashcode() of Object class is OVERRIDDEN in String class which returns an
    integer value that generated based on unicode values of every character
    Present in given String.
->  toString() of Object class is OVERRIDDEN in String class which returns an
    String value present in given String.
->  equals() of Object class is OVERRIDDEN in String class which Compares
    Character present in given 2 String and returns True if they are same 
    else return False.
