The main() is the starting point for JVM to start execution of a Java program. 
Without the main() method, JVM will not execute the program. 

The syntax of the main() method is:
       ________________________________________________
      |                                                |
      |    Public static void main (String [] args)    |
      |________________________________________________|   

public: 
     It is an access specifier. We should use a public keyword before the main() method 
     so that JVM can identify the execution point of the program. If we use private, 
     protected, and default before the main() method, it will not be visible to JVM.

static: 
      You can make a method static by using the keyword static. We should call the main() 
      method without creating an object. Static methods are the method which invokes 
      without creating the objects, so we do not need any object to call the main() method.

void: 
      In Java, every method has the return type. Void keyword acknowledges the compiler 
      that main() method does not return any value.

main(): 
      It is a default signature which is predefined in the JVM. It is called by JVM to 
      execute a program line by line and end the execution after completion of this 
      method. We can also overload the main() method.

String args[]: 
      The main() method also accepts some data from the user. It accepts a group of strings, 
      which is called a string array. It is used to hold the command line arguments in the 
      form of string values.
